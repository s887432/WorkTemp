Phum Viphurit - The Art of Detaching One's Heart

Words roaming inside my chest,
'cause, my fucked up head,
belongs to you.
Lost in space, we flew astray,
I'll find my way,
to get to you.
I, thought we were happy.
I, fell out of love.
It's not like before. (May we meet once more.)
Hearts may change, but memories won't,
you know I don't,
I don't want to go.
Was I dreaming of,
the design of love.
if we keep this up,
will we self-destruct?
